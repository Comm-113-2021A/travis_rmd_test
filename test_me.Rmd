## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r load-package}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(fivethirtyeight)
```

## Including Plots

# For this code block, test it by commenting out line with library(fivethirtyeight)
ggplot(hate_crimes, aes(x= median_house_inc, share_vote_trump)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
# For this code block, test file paths
file_path <- here("data", "dem_score.csv")
dem_score <- read_csv(file_path)
```
